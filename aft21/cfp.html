    <h1>Call for Papers</h1>

    <!-- Acm_logo_standalone-150x150.jpg -->

    <p>
      The ACM conference on Advances in Financial Technologies (AFT) is a premier venue for presenting the
      latest developments in technologies related directly and indirectly to novel financial infrastructure such as
      cryptocurrencies and their applications, blockchains, and exchanges.&nbsp;<br>Papers may present advances in the
      theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of relevant
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions. Proceedings will be published with
      open-access by the ACM.

  <h3>Submissions Policy</h3>

    <p>All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published
      or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be
      grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is
      not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are
      questions about this policy.<br></p>

  <h3>SoK</h3>

    <p>We welcome Systemization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These are not surveys of prior academic work but rather organization
      of results presented informally by the open-source community or used in operational projects. SoK submissions
      should be clearly marked with an “SoK:” prefix in their title.&nbsp;<br></p>

    <h3>Anonymous Submission</h3>

    <p>Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on
      the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous
      work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Only blind the reference itself in the
      (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. Publication as a technical report or in an online
      repository does not constitute a violation of this policy. Contact the program chairs if you have any questions.
      Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.<br></p>

    <h3>Conflict of Interest</h3>

    <p>During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest
      of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a
      paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following
      definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the
      following conditions holds:<br></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
      <li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.<ul>
          <li>For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same
            research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC
            member from the larger organization.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.</li>
      <li>The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
      <li>The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
      <li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the
      nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. Papers with incorrect or
      incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate
      rejection.<br></p>

<p>When a program co-chair is conflicted, the other co-chair will be responsible for managing that paper. When both program co-chairs are in conflict, a committee member will be appointed to handle the paper. Program co-chairs are not allowed to be authors or co-authors of any submissions.</p>



    <h3>Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations</h3>

    <p>Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even
      anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk or affect financial situation of humans in existing
      systems, must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics
        review boards (IRB) if applicable.</li>
      <li>Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were
        treated ethically and with respect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the submission deals with vulnerabilities (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program or design
      weaknesses in a hardware system), the authors need to discuss in detail the steps they have taken or plan to take
      to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors). The same applies if the
      submission deals with personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data.&nbsp;<strong>If a
        paper raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected based on these
        concerns</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>

    <h3>Page Limit and Formatting</h3>

    <p>Submitted papers may include up to 12 pages of text in double-column ACM format (see <a
        href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>),
      and unlimited pages for references and appendices. Latex submissions should use the <em>sigconf</em> template. <br>
    </p>

    <p>All submissions will be automatically checked for conformance to these requirements. Failure to adhere to the
      page limit and formatting requirements are grounds for immediate rejection.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>A total of 13 pages is allowed for camera-ready papers. Appendices will be read at the reviewers’ discretion.
      <br></p>

    <h3>Submission</h3>

    <p>Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts,
      images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render correctly in Adobe
      Reader 9 and when printed in black and white.&nbsp;<br></p>



    <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>

    <p>Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. At least one of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to register for the conference.  In the event of an in-person meeting, one of the authors is expected to attend and deliver a presentation at the meeting.  Authors may contact the program chairs directly to enquire about exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
